# BF-Interpreter

An interpreter for [Brainf***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) make as a project to help teach myself Rust. Designed around using the first 8 chapters of content of [the book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/title-page.html).

The program first takes the BF code as input and then the inputs that program will use as a second input. Any inputs beyond what the user provided on runtime will be defaulted to 0.
